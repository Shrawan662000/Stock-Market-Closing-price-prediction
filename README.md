# Stock-Market-Closing-price-prediction
### Objectives : The objective of the analysis is to predict the closing value of a Stock (e.g., WIPRO, TMS, INFOSYS, RELIANCE) by suitable method and visualizing the data.

In this project, I used time series forecasting methods, specifically the ARIMA model, to predict the closing stock prices of
four Indian companies: Wipro, Infosys, Tata Motors, and Reliance. I applied various data analysis techniques to analyze the
time series data and build an accurate predictive model. The goal of the project was to provide insights into the future performance of these stocks and potentially inform investment decisions. This likely involved preparing the data for modeling, selecting appropriate parameters for the ARIMA model, training and evaluating the model, and using the model to make predictions on future stock prices. Finally, I deployed this model using streamlit.
